<h1>Linux Commands to File Permissions</h1>

 ### 

<h2>Project Description</h2>
The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory . The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure. To complete this task, I performed the following tasks<br />

<b> Check file and directory details: </b> 
 <br/> The following code demonstrates how I used Linux commands to determine the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system. <br/>

<br/> The first line of the screenshot displays the command I entered, and the other lines display the output. The code lists all contents of the projects directory. I used the ls command with the -la option to display a detailed listing of the file contents that also returned hidden files. The output of my command indicates that there is one directory named drafts, one hidden file named .project_x.txt, and five other project files. The 10-character string in the first column represents the permissions set on each file or directory.<br/>
